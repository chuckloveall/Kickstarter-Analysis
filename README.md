# Kickstarter-Analysis
An analysis of 4000 kickstarter projects to look at what makes a project successful. 
Conditional formatting is applied to cells based on state (failed, canceled, successful). 
Created a percent funded category calculated from funding received relative to the project's goal. Conditional formatting is then applied on a three-color scale. 0 is red, green is 100, blue at 200. 
Created a new column for average donation based on the number of donors. 
Split the category and sub-category into new columns for further analysis. 
Created a new sheet with a pivot table breaking down state by category and a new sheet for sub-category. 
Created a new sheet with a pivot table filterable by country.
Converted Unix timestamps to a more readable format, creating new columns for date ended and created. 
Created a new sheet with a pivot table using date created based on parent category over the year. 
Created a new sheet with bins based on goal amount, charting the state per range. 
Created a summary table with statistical analysis of donors.
